:sectnums:

== Overview
This repository contains the **Bowen Family Systems Ontology**, a formal representation of the concepts and relationships central to Bowen Family Systems Theory. This ontology is designed to facilitate the modeling and analysis of family dynamics and relationships within a semantic framework, enabling better understanding and reasoning about family systems.

The ontology is developed in OWL (Web Ontology Language) and provides a structured framework to represent family relationships, processes, and individual characteristics as understood in Bowen Family Systems Theory.

== Ontology URI
The ontology is identified by the following base URI: https://www.vberg.dev/ontologies/bowen-familiy-system#

== Structure
The ontology includes several key components:

- **Classes**: Concepts such as `Person`, `Family`, `DifferentiationOfSelf`, and `EmotionalCutoff`.
- **Object Properties**: Relationships between individuals, including `hasParent`, `hasChild`, `hasSibling`, `hasAunt`, `hasUncle`, and others.
- **Data Properties**: Attributes of individuals, such as `hasFirstName`, `hasLastName`, `hasDateOfBirth`, etc.
- **Individuals**: Instances of classes, such as `Firstborn`, `Secondborn`, `Male`, `Female`, etc.
- **Rules**: SWRL rules to infer relationships such as `hasFullSibling`, `hasHalfSibling`, and `hasAunt`.

== Usage
=== In OWL/RDF Tools
You can load this ontology in tools such as Protégé, TopBraid Composer, or any RDF store that supports OWL.

=== In SPARQL Queries
You can query the ontology using SPARQL, extracting and analyzing data based on the family systems model.

=== In Reasoning Engines
Leverage the SWRL rules included in the ontology for reasoning tasks to infer implicit relationships and properties.

== Contributing
Contributions are welcome. If you find issues or have suggestions for enhancements, please submit them via the issue tracker or create a pull request.
The ontology must be serialized as Turtle through Protégé before creating a pull request.
