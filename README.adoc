= Kinship Ontology
:sectnums:

Welcome to the Kinship Ontology repository! This ontology is designed to model kinship relationships within a family, including various roles, relationships, and attributes.
The ontology's primary goal is to be compatible with Web Protégé and act as a base for the Bowen Family System Theory ontology.
This is to enable the usage of Web Protégé to create graphs of family systems.

== Overview
The Kinship Ontology provides a formal structure for representing family relationships and individual attributes within a kinship network. It includes classes for `Person` and `Family`, as well as properties to define relationships such as parenthood, sibling relationships, birth order, and more.

== Ontology Details
* **IRI**: `https://www.vberg.dev/ontologies/kinship#`
* **Prefix**: `kinship`

== Usage
You can use this ontology in your semantic web applications to model and query kinship relationships. The ontology is serialized in Turtle (.ttl) format and can be loaded into any RDF-compatible software or ontology editor, such as Protégé.
